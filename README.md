## REST API: Total Votes
A restaurant rating application collects ratings or votes from its users and stores them in a database. They want to allow users to retrieve the total vote count for
restaurants in a city.
Implement a function, getVoteCount. Given a city name and the estimated cost for the outlet, make a GET request to the API
at https://jsonmock.hackerrank.com/api/food outlets?city=<cityName>&<estimated_cost=<estimatedCost> where <cityName> and <estimatedCost> are the parameters passed to the function.

The response is a JSON object with the following 5 fields:
- page: The current page of the results. (Number)
- per_page: The maximum number of results returned per page. (Number)
- total: The total number of results. (Number)
- total_pages: The total number of pages with results. (Number)
- data: Either an empty array or an array that contains the food outlets' records.

In data, each food outlet has the following schema:
- id - outlet id (Number)
- name: The name of the outlet (String)
- city: The city in which the outlet is located (String)
- estimated_cost: The estimated cost of the food in the particular outlet (Number).
- user_rating: An object containing the user ratings for the outlet. The object has the following schema:
- average_rating: The average user rating for the outlet (Number)
- votes: The number of people who voted the outlet (Number)

If there are no matching records returned, the data array will be empty. In that case, the getVoteCount function should return -1.
An example of a food outlet record is as follows:
```
{
  "city": "Seattle",
  "name": "Cafe Juanita",
  "estimated_cost": 160,
  "user_rating": {
    "average_rating": 4.9,
    "votes": 16203
  },
  "id": 41
}
```

Use the votes property of each outlet to calculate the total vote count of all the matching outlets.
